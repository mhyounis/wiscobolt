Data from EADL.

Can also be found in:
"Tables and Graphs of Atomic Subshell and Relaxation Data Derived from the LLNL Evaluated Atomic Data Library (EADL), Z = 1 -100"
Perkins et al. (1991)

The file Z.dat contains data for atomic number Z. Data is organized as follows:
Transitions occur through 3 shells at a time.
Different shells are demarcated by -1137 -1137
The end of the file is marked by -1 -1
The first column is the efficiency, the second is the energy of the emitted particle.
